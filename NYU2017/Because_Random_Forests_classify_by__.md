Because Random Forests classify by majority voting on a binary class, they can be assessed using a metric called the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), which score the performance based on probability estimates of the positive class at differing thresholds. In Figure 12, the dotted diagonal represents randomly guessing the class. The further left the ROC curve is from the diagonal, the better the model is at predicting a true positive. The Random Forest classifier with hot-encoded categorical variables performed the best. Next was the Random Forest fitted without timeline event-related data, followed by the Random Forest with numeric and binary data only. This is expected because the latter two models have a smaller feature space. However, it appears there are only slight improvements between the models.
