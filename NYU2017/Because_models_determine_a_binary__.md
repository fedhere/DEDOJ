Because models determine a binary class, they can be measured using a metric called Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), which is based on the probability estimates of the positive class at different thresholds. In Figures \ref{fig:demoROC} and \ref{fig:nodemoROC}, the dashed diagonal lines represent randomly guessing the class. The farther left the model curve falls from the diagonal, the more accurate the model is at predicting the postive class. Our random forest and gradient boosted tree model perform similarly for each set of input variables. Removing the timeline-related data degrades the performance of the model significantly, pulling the curves closer to the 45 degrees line. From this we infer that the timeline-related variables have importance generating predictions of long-duration dispositions. By the same analysis, the fact that there is little to distinguish the performance of the models when demographic variables are removed from consideration in either set of models indicates that demographics does not have importance in generating these predictions. This is consistent with the exploratory analysis performed above.
