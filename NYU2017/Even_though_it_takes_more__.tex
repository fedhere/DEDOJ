Even though it takes more than twice as long to reach disposition for
defendants who have at some point been found to be not competent to
stand trial, this or any of the other engineered features will not
explain delays in the prosecutorial process on their own. The case of
being not competent to stand trial is an exception, applicable to 2\%
of the defendants in the dataset. In the last section of this paper,
we construct models to identify the most prominent drivers of
prosecutorial delay.
