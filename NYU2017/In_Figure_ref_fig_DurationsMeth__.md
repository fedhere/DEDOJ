In Figure \ref{fig:DurationsMeth}Â we have isolated the most commonly found charge in the data, violation of Health and Safety Code 11377(a) which is the possession of methamphetamine. The figure shows case duration for different races/ethnicities on the same charge. Again, we conclude that there is no statistically significant difference in the duration of the process for different races/ethnicities.
