In \autoref{fig:ViolinsCompetency} we see the same breakdown for
defendants who have at some point during a case been found to be not
competent to stand trial plotted against all other defendants. While
this is a very rare occurrence,
%(MISSIN DATA) 
it drives the most significant difference in the distribution of
durations. The most common time of arraignment, plea, and disposition
for these defendants doesn't show significant differences, as the
motion to evaluate competence to stand trial would occur later in the
process.  However, the median duration to disposition extends past a
year, and most commonly the last event of these cases happens very
late in the process, after 1000 days. Based on data from January
through June 2014 the median time to disposition for defendants who
are at some point not competent to stand trial was 353 days. For other
defendants (excluding the aforementioned group) it was 135 days.
