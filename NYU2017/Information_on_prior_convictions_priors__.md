Information on prior convictions ("priors") of defendants turned out to be incomplete so it was not possible to reliably assess whether a defendant had a prior, and more importantly, a strike prior (one which is applied to California's "three strikes" penalties). This information may be important in predicting prosecutorial duration, and we will hopefully be able to incorporate it in a future study.
