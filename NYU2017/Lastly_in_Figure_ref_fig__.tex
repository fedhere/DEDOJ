Lastly, in \autoref{fig:2ndModal} we have isolated the second most
common charge found in the dataset, theft of property—PC 459-460(b)–
since Proposition 47 reclassified HS 11377(a) and this would no longer
be a felony in charges issued after 2014. There are only 312
observations of this kind, but again, no differences appear.
