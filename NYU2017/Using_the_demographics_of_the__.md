Using the demographics of the data and the timeline of cases gives us an access to case duration for different demographics. In Figure \ref{fig:DurationsEthnicity} we see case duration by race/ethnicity. Duration is measured in days between the creation of a case until its resolution. From this figure, we can conclude that there is no statistically significant difference in the duration of the process for different races/ethnicities in our case dataset.
