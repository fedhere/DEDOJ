We can extend this examination to include other key events of a case. In Figure \ref{fig:ViolinsCustody}, we see time to arraignment, plea, disposition and the last event for defendants initially in custody against defendants initially not in custody. We see that both arraignment and plea most commonly happens very early in the process for those defendants initially in custody. Based on data from January through June of 2014 the median time to disposition for defendants in custody was 89 days. For those out of custody it was 192.5 days.
