Distributions of duration of the full prosecutorial process, from case issuing to disposition, for felony cases issued between January and June 2014 by the SCC DA.  In each plot a distribution is shown as a histogram smoothed with a kernel density estimate for two samples (blue and green) split along the vertical axis for comparison: a so-called {\it violin} plot. Each violin plot shows the time-to-plea distribution for two subsets of our data. The horizontal bar indicates the IQR (thick bar), full statistical distribution without outliers (thin bar) and median (white dot) for the {\it top} distribution. We compare time-to-disposition for defendants (from the top left) going {\it vs} not going to trial, charged of crimes with {\it vs} without a gang enhancement, which plead guilty {\it vs} not guilty or {\it nolo contendere}, {\it nolo contendere} {\it vs} guilty or not guilty, charged with one {\it vs} more than one charge, who waived {\it vs} did not waive time (Teble \ref{tab:Features}), who had {\it vs} did not have a preliminary hearing, charged as a single defendant {\it vs} with others (often occurring in gang related charges), and that pleas guilty {\it vs} not guilty or {\it nolo contendere}
