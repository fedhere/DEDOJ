Days to plea plotted against days to disposition for felony cases issued by SCC in January-June 2014. No disposition can happen before the plea, hence the bottom right portion of the plot is empty. The SCC DA indicated the long duration of the prosecutorial process up to plea, which is uncharacteristically long due to peculiarities of the laws that in SCC do not require a defendant to enter a plea early in the case, would drive the long duration of the prosecutorial process to disposition. However, in this plot we see a large fraction of defendant-case pairs at the top left of the plot, with short time to plea, and yet long time-to-disposition, indicating that delays in entering a plea are only partially responsible for delays in the prosecutorial process up to disposition.
