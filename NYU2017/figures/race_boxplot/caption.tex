Case duration, measured as days between case issue and disposition, by different race/ethnicitiy. For each ethnic group, the horizontal line within the box represents the median case duration. The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), the "whiskers" represent the full distribution, excluding statistical outliers, which are shown as individual data points. No statistically robust differences appear, as all the medians fall in the 25--75 percentiles of all other groups. Curiously, the distribution for Unknown/Other (missing and uncommon ethnic groups) is only marginally consistent with most of the other distributions. We speculate this may be due to cases issued against defendants that are not in custody and not reachable/fleeing from custody, and wish to test this in the future
