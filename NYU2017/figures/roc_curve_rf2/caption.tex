ROC curves for the RF and GBT models, with the addition of Demographic Data. The ROC plots show True Positive (completeness) {\it vs} False Positive rate (purity) of a classifier. The ROCs change slightly depending on the subset of variables in the model. The two ensemble methods exhibit similar performance. The addition of the Time-Related features improve the accuracy of the predictions and therefore we infer that they are important covariates for the prediction of long duration dispositions.
