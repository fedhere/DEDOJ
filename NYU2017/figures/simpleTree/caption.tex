A single decision tree using the training data set, separating the data into the two classes "disposition less than one year" and "disposition greater than one year". At each decision node of the graph, the tree splits on the variable indicated, represented with two arrows drawn below it. The node indicates the boolean test on which the split is performed, the Gini coefficient (representing the purity of the node with respect to the final classification scheme), the number of samples on which the test is performed, and the size of each of the two true classifications. The data is split with the data for which the boolean test is True going to the left child node, and the data for which the boolean test is False going to the right child node. The performance of this tree would be evaluated by measuring how well it classifies a labeled test data set, using the final classifications in the terminal nodes (the "leaves" of the tree), which are assigned to the class having the larger number of observations in the population.
