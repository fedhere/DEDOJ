Screenshot of our visualization tool designed to enable exploration of SCC prosecutorial data running in the Chrome web browser. The visualization tool breaks down the prosecutorial process into four phases: case issue-to-arraignment, arraignment-to-plea, plea-to-disposition, disposition-to-last logged event, and enables aggregation, filtering, and sorting on other axes: demographic, court related categories, etc. Here the visualization is using synthetic data, binned and aggregated on age ranges and sorted by the duration of the second phase (``arraignment to plea''). Note that the $x$-axis (days) is aligned such that the second phase starts at $t = 0$ and the first phase is shown extending in to the negative portion of the domain. Also shown is an example of the distribution information that is displayed when the user hovers over a bar using a pointing device: minimum, maximum, and a box plot showing the entire distribution for that prosecutorial phase (arraignment-to-plea) and the category belonging to that bar (defendant between 21 and 25 years of age).
