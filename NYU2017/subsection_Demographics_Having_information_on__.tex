\subsection{Demographics}
Having information on age and race/ethnicity allows us to explore the demographics of the data. In Figure~\ref{fig:EthnicBreakdown} we see how the defendants's race/ethnicity breakdown compares to that of the population of SCC. There are some disparities between the two with some ethnicities over- or under- represented in the data. The defendants' age decreases steadily (Figure~\ref{fig:AgeBreakdown}) and the majority of defendants are male (Figure~\ref{fig:GenderBreakdown}). Greatest number of defendants come from the zipcodes around San Jose, as well as zipcodes 95037 and 95020 to the south of San Jose, see Figure \ref{fig:map}
